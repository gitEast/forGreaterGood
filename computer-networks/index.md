## 0. Introduction to Computer Networks

### 0.1. 章节介绍

- Chapter 1 Fundamentals: 基本原理
- Chapter 2 Data Link Layer
- Chapter 3 Network Layer
- Chapter 4 Transport Layer
- Chapter 5 Application Layer
- Chapter 6 Network Security

### 0.2 Computer Network 解析

- A computer network is a set of **nodes** connected by **communication links**.
  - nodes:
    - A node can be a computer, printer or any other device capable of(能够) sending/receiving data generated by other nodes in network.
    - examples: Computer, Server, Printer, Security Camera, Switches, Bridges, Routers, etc...
  - communication links
    - A communication link can be a wired link or wireless link. The link carries the information.
      - wired link
      - wireless link
- end nodes and intermediary nodes
  | end devices | intermediary nodes |
  | ----- | ----- |
  | Printer | Cell Tower |
  | Desktop Computers | Switch |
  | Tablet | Router |
  | Web Server | Wireless Router |
  | Smart Phone | Modem |

### 0.3 Summary

- Understand "What is computer network?"
- Identify end devices and intermediary devices

## 1. Computer Networks - Basic Characteristics(基本特性)

### 1.1 be able to

1. understand the need for fault tolerant networks
2. understand the need for scalable networks
3. understand Quality of Service(QoS)(服务质量)
4. know the importance of security in computer networks

### 1.2 four basic characteristics

- Fault Tolerance
  1. Continue working despite(尽管) failures
  2. Ensure no loss of service
- Scalability
  1. Grow based on the needs
  2. Have good performance after growth
- Quality of Service
  1. Set priorities
  2. Manage data traffic to reduce data loss, delay etc...
     - real time communication
     - e-mail communication
- Security
  - prevent
    1. unauthorized access
    2. misuse
    3. forgery(伪造品，赝品)
  - provide
    1. confidentiality(保密性)
    2. integrity(完整性)
    3. availability

## 2. Network Protocols & Communications

### 2.1 be able to

1. Know "What is Data Communication"?
2. Understand data flow
3. Understand the importance of protocaols in computer network
4. Know the elements of protocol

### 2.2 Data Communication and Data Flow

- Data Communication
  - Data communications are the exchange of data between two nodes via(通过) some form of link(transmission medium)(传输介质) such as a cable(电缆).
- Data Flow
  - Simplex(单一的，单工的)
    - 书面定义：Communication is always unidirectional.
    - 通俗来讲：One device can transmit and the other device will receive.
    - examples: keyboards, traditional monitors
  - Half Duplex(双向的)
    - 书面定义： Communication is in both directions but not at the same time.
    - 通俗来讲：If one device is sending, the other can only receive, and vice versa(反之亦然).
    - example: walkie-talkie(步话机)
  - Full Duplex
    - 书面定义：Communication is in both directions simultaneously(同时地).
    - 通俗来讲：Device can send and receive at the same time.
    - example: telephone line

### 2.3 Protocols

- All communication schemes(方案，计划) will have the following things in common:
  1. source or sender
  2. destination or receiver
  3. channel or media
  - Rules or protocols governs all methods of communication.
- Protocol determins:
  1. What is communicated?
  2. How it is communicated?
  3. When it is communicated?
- Human Communication
  1. An identified sender and receiver.
  2. Common language and grammer.
  3. Speed and timming of delivery.
  4. Confirmation or acknowledgement requirements.
- Network Communication
  1. Message encoding
     - message source => encoder(signal) => transmitter => transmission medium(wired/wireless) => receiver => decoder => message destination
  2. Message formatting and encapsulation(封装，包装)
     - agreed format
     - encapsulate the information to identify the sender and the receiver rightly.
  3. Message timing(时间，时机)
     - flow control
     - response timeout
  4. Message size
     - Humans break long messages into smaller parts or sentences.
     - Long messages must also be broken into smaller pieces to travel across a network.
  5. Message delivery options
     - unicast
     - multicast
     - broadcast

### 2.4 Peer-to-Peer network and Client Server Network

- Peer-to-Peer Network
  - No centralized(集中的，中央集权的) administration.
  - All peers are equal.
  - Simple sharing applications
  - Not scalable.
- Client Server Network
  - Centralized administration
  - Request-Response model
  - Scalable
  - Server may be overloaded
